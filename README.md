# 🏋️‍♂️ Metal Fitness Tracker

## 📘 Overview
**Metal Fitness Tracker** is a data-driven fitness analytics project that leverages Python-based data science workflows to analyze and visualize user fitness performance over time.  
It focuses on **data cleaning, trend exploration, and actionable insights** derived from real or simulated fitness datasets.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📦 **Data Loading & Preprocessing** — Efficient handling of raw fitness data using `pandas` and `numpy`.  
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning Pipeline** — Removes inconsistencies, nulls, and outliers to prepare high-quality datasets.  
- 📊 **Visualization Suite** — Comprehensive analysis with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for performance trends.  
- 📈 **Statistical Insights** — Correlation and metric breakdowns to identify patterns in user activity.  
- 💡 **Interactive Exploration** — Jupyter/Colab-friendly code for live experimentation.
